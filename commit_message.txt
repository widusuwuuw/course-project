feat(my-screen): Implement placeholder screens for settings

This commit adds placeholder screens and navigation for "Notification Settings" and "Account & Security" within the "My" screen.

Changes include:
- Created NotificationSettingsScreen.tsx and AccountSettingsScreen.tsx placeholder files.
- Added these screens to App.tsx navigation.
- Wired up navigation from ProfileScreen.tsx buttons to the new screens.
- Restored metro.config.js to ensure NativeWind build compatibility.
